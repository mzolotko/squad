More powerful extensions of the Fermat primality test, such as the Baillie-PSW, Miller-Rabin, and Solovay-Strassen tests, are guaranteed to fail at least some of the time when applied to a composite number."},{"qas":[{"question":"Of what form are Sophie Germain primes?","id":"62ecacda00692d70ac3c65517","answers":[]},{"question":"Of what form are Mersenne primes?","id":"16eb0b2abd92e47832da24baf","answers":[]},{"question":"What test is especially useful for numbers of the form 2p - 1?","id":"beda6cbda5d311baa72751db6","answers":[]},{"question":"What is the name of one type of prime where p+1 or p-1 takes a certain shape?","id":"8e86ccfaad6faaddbf60f34c4","answers":[]},{"question":"What is the name of another type of prime here p+1 or p-1 takes a certain shape?","id":"3d7a2f0fd4ebdcc4aa9d2533b","answers":[]},{"question":"Of what form are Sophie Germain tests?","id":"eaec32fa6d92bacdeecf93255","answers":[]},{"question":"Of what form are Mersenne tests?","id":"ebe9d9bc95fdaa195408c2428","answers":[]},{"question":"What test is especially useful for tests of the form 2p-1?","id":"79936a9d1b99ae2bb34074acf","answers":[]},{"question":"What is the name of one type of test where p+1 or p-1 takes a certain shape?","id":"7274a78b4beb345fbfc0b6c64","answers":[]},{"question":"What is the name of another type of test where p+1 or p-1 takes a certain shape?","id":"45bd3fab3f8663f9df8ad3243","answers":[]}],"context":"are prime.

Over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas. Though small, this advantage appears to have been enough to drive natural selection in favour of a prime-numbered life-cycle for these insects."},{"qas":[{"question":"What does the word prime generally suggest?","id":"d5bedd0b34bcc2cebbb9c263d","answers":[]},{"question":"For a field F containing 0 and 1, what would be the prime field?","id":"e80ca4bf1cf49d6bf9b3d0007","answers":[]},{"question":"What does it mean for a knot to be considered indecomposable?","id":"aaddabbce33b0aabcda9ef8d7","answers":[]},{"question":"How can any knot be distinctively indicated?","id":"5c451df5dd9c1b1df1666a753","answers":[]},{"question":"What is an additional meaning intended when the word prime is used?","id":"cb5fb49c718c0fd4e79b7ca84","answers":[]},{"question":"What does the word component generally suggest?","id":"ed60b2ebeca313da5d6ec680d","answers":[]},{"question":"For a field F containing 0 and 1, what would be the prime knot field?","id":"accbbe9dcd873e65a3d4096bf","answers":[]},{"question":"What does it mean for a knot to be considered a p element?","id":"cbb6f3ebc666a3e0cee86f7a1","answers":[]},{"question":"How can any knot be a field of F?","id":"669bdcbb9e185ca2b9eecf270","answers":[]},{"question":"What is an additional meaning intended when the word component is used?","id":"ee472d6aa23343a13f0b7a719","answers":[]}],"context":"The concept of prime number is so important that it has been generalized in different ways in various branches of mathematics. Generally, \"prime\" indicates minimality or indecomposability, in an appropriate sense. For example, the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field F containing both 0 and 1. It is either Q or the finite field with p elements, whence the name. Often a second, additional meaning is intended by using the word prime, namely that any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components. For example, in knot theory, a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots. Any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots.

The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles \u2013 some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense.

Euplokamis' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60 milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type.

Detailed investigation of chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta, showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps, and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough of them around. Beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores. Some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores, and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations. Since ctenophores and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations in population, most fish that prey on them are generalists, and may have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jelly-eaters.

Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities. The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal \u2013 and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism.

A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage.

Richard Harbison's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic, in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid. Instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids. He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid-like or beroid-like. A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, using 26 species, including 4 recently discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like. It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small \u2013 so small that the relationships between the Lobata, Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain. This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent, and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished. When the analysis was broadened to include representatives of other phyla, it concluded that cnidarians are probably more closely related to bilaterians than either group is to ctenophores but that this diagnosis is uncertain."}]},{"title":"Jacksonville,_Florida","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"Which Florida city has the biggest population?","id":"afcfbaf44b7b5ca7a7cacecae","answers":[]},{"question":"What was the population Jacksonville city as of 2010?","id":"233c6002d2ea7fb153edadabd","answers":[]},{"question":"Based on population alone, what is Jacksonville's ranking in the United States?","id":"f73af7c0b7e768568fef68f45","answers":[]},{"question":"In which county does Jacksonville reside?","id":"c3ede37d0b433e5b532df391e","answers":[]},{"question":"What year did consolidation cause Jacksonville to become part of Duval County?","id":"d5d358d89dd4da11b48eaed7e","answers":[]},{"question":"Which Florida city has a smallest population?","id":"4a00e6dace9bd10bf0caa5264","answers":[]},{"question":"What County was Jacksonville the seat of prior to 1968?","id":"f7ac4bc7717ff5bcd71cbe073","answers":[]},{"question":"What year did Jacksonville consolidate with Davis County?","id":"349a2ed14cc5a1b2edbfa4a96","answers":[]},{"question":"What is the largest metropolitan area in Florida and the Southeast?","id":"f5922d151bacec42f70d3647d","answers":[]},{"question":"What city proper has a population of 1,345,596?","id":"66badf8af054bda021f8ae2aa","answers":[]}],"context":"Jacksonville is the largest city by population in the U.S. state of Florida, and the largest city by area in the contiguous United States.

Voters outside the city limits rejected annexation plans in six referendums between 1960 and 1965."},{"qas":[{"question":"How were most city officials elected in the 1960s?","id":"c8e6bf6caea12be9c12b75851","answers":[]},{"question":"How many city officials were indicted due to corruption?","id":"b84efa6add53a1da43ede3c2f","answers":[]},{"question":"What political group began to gain support following the corruption scandal?","id":"893a3f5181f1f4745a4de29d9","answers":[]},{"question":"What spurred increased support for government reform?","id":"af04eccd26f76fe18db3f6417","answers":[]},{"question":"How are most city officials elected after the 1960s","id":"ed3d4b6fe90aa328edfd0a25b","answers":[]},{"question":"How many former city officials were investigated by the grand jury?","id":"1341dccca9ab2bdf13d12f1e3","answers":[]},{"question":"What political group begin to lose support following the corruption scandals?","id":"524faf45e75eefeddd7c8eb0d","answers":[]},{"question":"What happened when public high schools gained accreditation?","id":"37e170e6e2bae73266def5bc8","answers":[]},{"question":"What were the reasons not to consolidate the government?","id":"a6aef4ad8f677ea37798374f6","answers":[]}],"context":"In the mid-1960s, corruption scandals began to arise among many of the city's officials, who were mainly elected through the traditional old boy network. After a grand jury was convened to investigate, 11 officials were indicted and more were forced to resign. Jacksonville Consolidation, led by J. J. Daniel and Claude Yates, began to win more support during this period, from both inner city blacks, who wanted more involvement in government, and whites in the suburbs, who wanted more services and more control over the central city. In 1964 all 15 of Duval County's public high schools lost their accreditation. This added momentum to proposals for government reform. Lower taxes, increased economic development, unification of the community, better public spending and effective administration by a more central authority were all cited as reasons for a new consolidated government."},{"qas":[{"question":"What was the result of the 1967 referendum?","id":"bb8cd5cff5c9f54fffcbabade","answers":[]},{"question":"Who was Jacksonville's mayor at the time of the consolidation?","id":"af4fee3a5e564daba0b65bd55","answers":[]},{"question":"What was Jacksonville referred to as after the consolidation?","id":"6c431dade913eb7d8ad77a70f","answers":[]},{"question":"What was the name of the approved measure that helped cover the cost of major city projects?","id":"479689a9674faf267bbede93a","answers":[]},{"question":"How did the Better Jacksonville Plan generate money?","id":"c4ec6cfea47cb46a35f637ea6","answers":[]},{"question":"What do voters reject in 1967","id":"ede73afdc0adec613d657632e","answers":[]},{"question":"What was formed when the government merged in 1967?","id":"4f0dddd75f5affbc657cd5f09","answers":[]},{"question":"Was services were not consolidated under the new government?","id":"fb7891fadbb6927f3e0ccd714","answers":[]},{"question":"What was Jacksonville referred to before the consolidation?","id":"a31293fa4c01ecddc1b454cd3","answers":[]}],"context":"When a consolidation referendum was held in 1967, voters approved the plan.

The strongest effect on Jacksonville was from Hurricane Dora in 1964, the only recorded storm to hit the First Coast with sustained hurricane-force winds.
